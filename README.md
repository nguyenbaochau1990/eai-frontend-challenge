## ElementAI frontend challenge

Welcome to the ElementAI frontend challenge! By completing the challenge below, you'll have a chance to show us that you're familiar with common frontend technologies and can use them to create a useful interface.

This challenge is meant to be used as a launch point for further discussions. With that in mind, we encourage you to keep your implementation simple and to leave any thoughts around making this a production-ready interface as points of a followup discussion.

## The goal

The goal of this challenge will be to implement a few components for rendering a file tree and displaying a selected file. We've already got you started with the component stubs (FileTree and FileContent). We've also included some mock file fixtures for you to use in `/src/fixtures/files.json`. You're free to design the interface as you like, keeping in mind that it is enough to display the given mock data in any straighforward, understandable way. Note, though, that we are looking for a *tree* and not a flat list!

You may also install any libraries and build tools you're used to working with, or not!

## What we'd like to see

- You organize your code in a clean, consistent manner
- You're able to handle data in React
- You have an eye for basic design principles

## What we don't need to see

- Pixel-perfect UI
- Cross browser compatiblity (any modern browser is ok)
- Any tests, unless you prefer to have them

## Submitting your challenge
To submit, .zip your completed challenge and send it to us in a return email. Please remove your `node_modules` directory before zipping. We also encourage you to include a small summary of your approach and describe anything you've left out for further discussion.

1. Please npm install
2. I finally use Redux for selectedFile as it start being complicate with callback function
3. As I said in the interview, I use recursive for FileTree to show all node
4. Thank you for the challenge!
